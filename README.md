minecraft minigames for chemistry

This is our first minecraft minigame developed by McGill MC4Chem science outreach team. This one is aimed at undergraduates taking physical chemistry
We hope this map will make your prep for the final a little funner!

Just download mc4chem.zip, upzip in your 'saves' folder and see how far you get.
Some instructions for how to find your 'saves' folder: https://savelocation.net/minecraft 
Tested using version 1.17.1 but it is likely transferable.
