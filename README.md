minecraft minigames for chemistry

This is our first minecraft minigame developed by McGill MC4Chem science outreach team. This one is aimed at undergraduates taking physical chemistry.
We hope this map will make your prep for the final a little funner!

Just download ZIP (Code --> Download ZIP), upzip, move the world folder to your 'saves', launch 1.17-ish version of MC Java edition and see how far you get!
Some instructions for how to find your 'saves' folder: https://savelocation.net/minecraft 
Tested using version 1.17.1 but it is likely transferable. 

If you teach pchem, please feel free to use this as basis for your own minigame. 
If you do, please don't forget to give us credit, follow us on twitter (@thesiminegroup, @McGillChemOut), and keep in touch :)
